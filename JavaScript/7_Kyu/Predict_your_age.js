/*

My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
Multiply each number by itself.
Add them all together.
Take the square root of the result.
Divide by two.
Example
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.

function predictAge(age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8) {   
    const sumOfSquare = age1 * age1 + age2 * age2 + age3 * age3 + age4 * age4 + age5 * age5 + age6 * age6 + age7 * age7 + age8 * age8
    const squareRoot = Math.sqrt(sumOfSquare)
    const result = squareRoot / 2;

    return Math.floor(result)
}

// Other methods.
const predictAge = (...ages) => Math.hypot(...ages) / 2 | 0;

// explanation...
Certainly! The solution you provided uses the `Math.hypot()` function, which is indeed often associated with calculating the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.However, it can also be used in this context to simplify the calculation of the sum of squares.

### Understanding`Math.hypot()`

The `Math.hypot()` function takes any number of arguments and calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of those arguments.The formula it implements is:

\[
    \text{ hypot }(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \sqrt{ x_1^ 2 + x_2 ^ 2 + \ldots + x_n ^ 2}
    \]

### How It Applies to the Problem

In the context of the `predictAge` function, the goal is to:

1. Square each age.
2. Sum those squares.
3. Take the square root of that sum.
4. Divide by 2.
5. Round down to the nearest integer.

    Using `Math.hypot()` allows you to directly compute the square root of the sum of squares without needing to manually square each age and sum them up. 

### Breakdown of the Solution

Hereâ€™s the solution you provided:

```javascript
const predictAge = (...ages) => Math.hypot(...ages) / 2 | 0;
```

1. ** Rest Parameter **: The `...ages` syntax allows the function to accept any number of arguments(in this case, the ages).This means you can call `predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45)` or any other combination of ages.

2. ** Using`Math.hypot()` **:
- `Math.hypot(...ages)` computes the square root of the sum of the squares of all the ages passed to the function. This is equivalent to:
\[
    \sqrt{ age1^ 2 + age2 ^ 2 + age3 ^ 2 + age4 ^ 2 + age5 ^ 2 + age6 ^ 2 + age7 ^ 2 + age8 ^ 2}
    \]

3. ** Dividing by 2 **: The result from `Math.hypot()` is then divided by 2.

4. ** Bitwise OR with 0(`| 0`) **: This is a shorthand way to round down the result to the nearest integer.In JavaScript, using the bitwise OR operator with 0 effectively truncates the decimal part, which is equivalent to using`Math.floor()`.

### Example Walkthrough

Using the same example:

```javascript
console.log(predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45)); // should return 86
```

1. ** Calculate Hypotenuse **:
- `Math.hypot(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45)` computes:
\[
    \sqrt{ 65^ 2 + 60 ^ 2 + 75 ^ 2 + 55 ^ 2 + 60 ^ 2 + 63 ^ 2 + 64 ^ 2 + 45 ^ 2 }
    \]
    - This results in approximately`160.9`.

2. ** Divide by 2 **:
- `160.9 / 2` gives approximately`80.45`.

3. ** Round Down **:
- `80.45 | 0` results in `80`.

### Conclusion

The use of`Math.hypot()` in this solution is a clever way to simplify the calculation of the sum of squares and the square root, making the code more concise.It effectively achieves the same result as the previous implementation but in a more elegant manner.If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
